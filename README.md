# rfidspotify

The original idea came from [@talaexe's project](https://github.com/talaexe/Spotify-RFID-Record-Player), I just added a few modifications to fit my use cases. 
However, if you're a beginner at python/coding, [@talaexe's code](https://github.com/talaexe/Spotify-RFID-Record-Player) may be easier to understand and get started. 


### Added behavior:     
- Switched to using custom Music objects to make loop/code less repetitive
- Logic to change the device the music is playing on (by using another RFID tag)
